This is an attempt to refactor my configuration into something sane using [blueprint](https://github.com/numtide/blueprint).

I'm hoping to simplify the management of my pi fleet through the use of [nixos-raspberrypi](https://github.com/nvmd/nixos-raspberrypi/) now that [raspberry-pi-nix](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/what-happened-to-raspberry-pi-nix/62417) is dead.
